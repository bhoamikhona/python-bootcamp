# Exercise 02: BMI 2.0

## Instructions

Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

- Under 18.5 they are underweight
- Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
- Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
- Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
- Above 35 they are clinically obese.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

**Warning:** You should **round** the result to the nearest whole number. The interpretation message needs to include the words in bold from the interpretations above. e.g. **underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, clinically obese**.

## Example Input

```
weight = 85
height = 1.75
```

## Example Output

```
85 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 27.755102040816325
Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

The testing code will check for print output that is formatted like one of the lines below:

```
"Your BMI is 18, you are underweight."
"Your BMI is 22, you have a normal weight."
"Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight."
"Your BMI is 33, you are obese."
"Your BMI is 40, you are clinically obese."
```

## Hint

1. Try to use the **exponent** operator in your code.
2. Remember to **round** your result to the nearest whole number.
3. Make sure you include the words in **bold** from the interpretations.

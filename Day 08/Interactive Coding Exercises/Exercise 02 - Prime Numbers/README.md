# Exercise 02: Prime Numbers

## Instructions

Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1.

[Prime Numbers - Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number)

**You need to write a function** that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.

e.g. 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2.

But, 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2, and 4.

## Example Input 1

```
73
```

## Example Output 1

```
It's a prime number.
```

## Example Input 2

```
75
```

## Example Output 2

```
It's not a prime number
```

## Hint

1. Remember the modulus: [Stackoverflow Query Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4432208/what-is-the-result-of-in-python)

2. Make sure you name your function/parameters the same as when it's called on the last line of code.

# Day 08 - Caesar Cipher

**About:** Today is all about building a cipher program and the cipher program is Caesar cipher. Caesar cipher is an ancient type of encryption. As the story goes, when Caesar wanted to send highly sensitive military messages, he would encode his message so that each letter would be shifted by a pre-determined amount. e.g. If we wanted to encode the letter "A" and we shifted it by 3, then "A" becomes "D", "B" becomes "E", and so on and so forth.

## Lessons Learned

- Function with Parameters
- Parameters vs. Arguments
  - <ins>Argument</ins> is the actual piece of data that is going to be passed over to the function when it is being called. - (variable value)
  - <ins>Parameter</ins> is the name of that data that is being passed. - (variable name)
- Positional vs. Keyword Arguments
- `math.ceil()` - To round UP to the nearest integer, if necessary, and returns the result.

# Day 14: Higher Lower Game

**About:** Today is all about building an exciting game called [Higher or Lower](http://www.higherlowergame.com/). It's easy to play. You will be shown two cards and you simply have to decide whether the second card is searched for higher or lower than the first card. As you progress, you will be shown a new card. Choose higher or loser to decide whether it is searched for more or less than the previous card. The objective is to get the most right in a row. If you get one wrong, you lose the game. Good Luck!

## FAQ

- Why does choice B always become choice A in every round, even when A had more followers?
  - Suppose you just started the game and you are comparing the followers of A - Instagram (364k) to B - Selena Gomez (174k). Instagram has more followers, so choice A is correct. However, the subsequent comparison should be between Selena Gomez (the new A) and someone else. The reason is that everything in our list has fewer followers than Instagram. If we were to keep Instagram as part of the comparison (as choice A) then Instagram would stay there for the rest of the game. This would be quite boring. By swapping choice B for A each round, we avoid a situation where the number of followers of choice A keeps going up over the course of the game. Hope that makes sense. ðŸ™‚

# Day 12: Number Guessing Game

**About:** The goal of this project is to build a game where the player is supposed to guess the number that the computer has randomly chosen before he/she runs out of attempts to guess, all while applying the concepts of Namespace and Global Constants.

## Lessons Learned

- Namespace
  - Local Scope
  - Global Scope
- Python has no Block Scope
- Modify Variables with Global Scope
  - `global` keyword
    - The `global` keyword allows us to modify the variable outside of the current scope.
    - It is also used to create global variables from a no-global scope e.g. inside a function
- Global Constants
- Errors:
  - NameError

# Day 05 - Password Generator

**Backstory:** All sorts of companies seem to be getting hacked these days. Everything from Ashley Madison to Verizon, everybody seems to be really bad at keeping your password safe. So, how can we make sure that these hackers in hoodies and wearing face masks don't get to you and your account? One of the most common reasons that hackers get into your account is password reuse. Using the same password on 20 different websites from Google to Facebook to Skype to Spotify to all the random services that we sign up to. The problem is that when one of these sites get hacked then the email and password combination you used to sign up is compromised. So, all the hacker has to do is to try out those credentials on a bunch of other websites, and see if they work. So, how do we keep our selves safe? Here comes the password generator to the rescue which is going to generate strong passwords with letters, symbols, and numbers. It asks you how many letters, numbers, and symbols you'd like in your password and generate a password for you.

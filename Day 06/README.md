# Day 05 - Reeborg's World Maze

Today is all about learning code blocks, indentations, functions, and also a different flavor from the for loops, which is while loops. To learn all these concepts, we're going to take help of [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html). By the end of the day, the final project is to instruct Reeborg, the robot, to be able to complete any randomly generated maze on Reeborg's world.

## Lessons Learned

- Functions
  - Some of the functions we've already come across:
    - `len()`
    - `int()`
    - `print()`
    - `range()`
    - The reason why we know that mentioned above are functions is because, the names are followed by a set of parentheses.
  - Creating Functions
  - Calling Functions
- Indentation and Code Blocks
- Spaces vs. Tabs: Python Docs recommends spaces over tabs.
- While Loops

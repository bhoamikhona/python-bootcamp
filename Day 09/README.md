# Day 09 - Silent Auction

**About:** We all know that there are auctions where everybody bids and you can see everybody else's bid and the auctioneer gets you to bid higher and higher values. Now, there is also a type of auction called a silent auction where everybody bids silently and no one knows the other person's bids until at the very end of the auction where the highest bid is revealed. That's what we are building today.

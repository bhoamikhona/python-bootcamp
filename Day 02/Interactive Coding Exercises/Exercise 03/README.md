# Exercise 3 - Life in Weeks

## Instructions

I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

**Warning** your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

## Example Input

## Example Output

e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

## Hint

1. There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
2. Try copying the example output into your code and replacing the relevant parts so that the sentence is formated the same way.

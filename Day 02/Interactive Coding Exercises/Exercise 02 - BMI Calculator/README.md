# Exercise 02: BMI Calculator

## Instructions

Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

**Warning:** You should convert the result to a whole number.

## Example Input

```
weight = 80
height = 1.75
```

## Example Output

```
80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
26
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

## Hint

1. Check the data type of the inputs.
2. Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
3. Remember PEMDAS
4. Remember to convert your result to a whole number (int).

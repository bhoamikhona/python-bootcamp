# Day 01 - Band Name Generator

**Backstory:** Let's sat that your friend was starting a new band, a rock band or a classical band, and they are struggling to come up with a good name. So, I come in to the rescue and send them my band name generator program. So, it asks you for the name of the city you grew up in (mine was Bombay in India) and the name of your pet (I have a playful companion dog whom I lovingly call Otter), and when I hit enter, the program gives me my band name and it could be "Bombay Otter".

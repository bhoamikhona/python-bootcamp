# Exercise 03: Input Function

## Instructions

Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.

e.g.

**Warning:** Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.

## Example Input

```
Angela
```

## Example Output

```
6
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

## Hint

1. You can put functions inside other functions.
2. Don't try to print anything other than the length.

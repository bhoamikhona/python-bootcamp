# Exercise 2: Debugging Practice

## Instructions

Look at the code in the code editor on the right. There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.

**Warning:** The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.

## Example Output

When you run your program, it should print the following:

```
Day 1 - String Manipulation
String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n.
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, there should be no errors and this is what should happen:
